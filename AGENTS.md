It's kind of funny, probably kind of stupid, but. Maybe we should. Include dummy proof buttons, for example. If I pressed a certain button. It would be. For example. To install. If I press another button it will be to build. If I press another button it would be to. Run the server or run the script like a dummy proof. Button. Instead of typing the actual NPM or PMPM or vite If we can also include that into. The dashboard. Another thing that would be very very helpful. Extremely helpful, matter of fact Since we already have five agents. Working for the back end. We have AI Gateway we have. I can add other API endpoints if you like. To include. A real time chatbot. Into the dashboard. That is also wired up with the back end with the front end. Dad knows what's going on, what's happening at every state, every moment. In case I do have a issue or trouble or what not, it would help me. So pretty much a help. Helpful. Chat bot. We need to configure a json Configuration for. The MCP tools that we will be providing through the orchestrator. Or the orchestrator to be able to connect to. And for us from the outside to be able to connect. Multiple. Various. MCP tools for. The orchestrator to be able to work with the agents in case they need any type of tool. It's there to help him on the spot so we don't have to. Search for anything, come back later. None of that stuff. Many will be very helpful for the dashboard and the environment.
Would you please add? Another feature on the dashboard. Where I would be able to easily. Add more tools. And for it to display in real time whatever tool we have configured. And connected if it's actually connected if it's not. If there's an issue with. We could possibly fix it. As far as connected to. External tools But let's do it in a way with. For whatever. Whatever we're connected to on the dashboard that the orchestrator also has. The capability of. I'm using it I know there are a bunch of different MCP connections out there. That don't require API keys. For example file search or. File Explorer or. Web scraper I know there are many many out there, especially memory. Mem  ory is a huge. Part of this it would help a lot.  Since we're doing Neon Database  Here is the. Instructions to. Connect to NEON? We might as well connect Via MCP <https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server> If you can think of any other let me know. I can get API keys if it's important to our use case. And if you could also include. The main. MCP connections. With their configurations. For our use case, that would be amazing. Most importantly, since we are going to be working with. Mostly repository Bing Github might as well reconnect or if you cannot make the connection and the configuration. With Github as well I have the. I have all the credentials whatever we need. It would be nice if we could also connect with. vercel, subabase , vs code , And the MCP store. But also like I said. Have an area in on the dashboard where I would be able to easily. Just add the configuration. Crowd with either NPX or NPM or whatever it is, or even with Claude Desktop I should be able to. I'm trying to make it very easy for the agents to do their work to be in and out of there properly. I understand The connection is good with localhost 3001. I would much rather prefer for. It to also. Be available. On a stronger domain rather than just local host 3001. You are more than welcome to use codehomie.chat  That would be much better connectivity for me as well as I'd like to also. Sometimes use my. Phone like right now I do have it on. I do have it deployed on Vercell. And I was just checking it. I have stronger analytics. I can check with Russell on my phone. As far as data. That's why I would like to have it. Also with the domain I am going to deploy it, well it is. It is already deployed on Vercell. Because I like to use their analytics. It gives me a better understanding of the data and everything. So to have a stronger endpoint that would be. More ideal For data tracking. Different. Charts I would be using. Not just the logs. That would be great. I would highly appreciate it if you would add codehomie.chat  Also configured with production readiness.

This is exactly what we're building make. Blueprints make. agents.Md make read.Md make whatever you want to make. So you keep on remembering what we're building here. Don't break anything that we have going on now, but add to it. Update your little HTML dashboard that's falling apart stuck together with band aid into the shadcn ui Complete dashboard that I have. Number 16 or number 7 I have the URL in the following.
Implement everything that I have mentioned in here. No questions asked. Do not come back unless you are completely done. Completely ready production, ready production grade. I need to ship it right now and use it right now.
Please thoroughly analyze the images I've sent. Identify it. Understand it. Understand the flow of it. Summarize it. Be a master at it and also. Thoroughly searched, scrape whatever you need to do. You have all the tools. You have a lot of MCP tools you can use MCP connections. You can use tools you are connected. Get all the information how? Codex works <https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud> How it works? How it operates? How we can? Architect. A strategy we can build something similar to codecs, but with 4 agents working parallel. Simultaneously. And one. Orchestrator. Which would be the 5th agent. Routing and. Calling the tools, calling the agents. When it's their turn to go for. A Python script for. Modularizing Big zipped folder. Here's how it would go down. This is my vision.

all components including sandbox will be from vercel ai sdk and shadcn ui only modern comonants nothing old , we will use ai gateway for the models - IT USES 1 API KEY OR OIDC TO WIRE UP 100+ MODELS AT A TIME So if we want to send 50 agents for example, we can do this and accomplish this with one API key. 1 API wiring I have the complete setup. If you want I can send you the documentation. The setup is just to get you started with. The actual AI gateway. Implementation. Rule number three is going to be no fall backs. Zero fall backs. I know AI, gateway loves to do fall backs. If it. Has it. That's fine. For anything else besides AI, gateway, zero, fall backs. I don't care what it is, if we have a problem, it needs to pop up a message saying you have a problem or you there's an error. #4. This is for myself. This is not for nobody else to not put any authentications. I don't want it. I don't care for it. I don't need it. It's only mine. There's no login. None of that crap. Do you understand????   If we have to and we need to. And I'm sure we do need to, because we need to track every single step of the way streaming in real time. With. 5 chat interfaces. Lined up. So we could watch and see every second what? The agent is thinking what it's doing, what every step. On top of that, we are logging every single thing, so we will have 6 boxes on the screen. We don't need a landing page, none of that stuff. All in all we need to do is have 6 chat boxes. Like a control panel type. Three on the top, three on the bottom, nicely, neatly with. The components that I told you that we're going to use from. So we can see every step of the way. Only do I have a emergency stop button. And a pause and pause and start button In case we stop them. We communicate with the orchestrator and we can communicate at all times with the orchestrator. You need to write a blueprint. Put together architecture of how it's gonna be. Visually create. I don't know what is called the not the Kanban, the other one, but. The grid canva grid boxes of. The actual workflow, how it's going to be done? I need another file for rules, another file for instructions each. Agent will have a name, not a number. The orchestrator will have a name. You can pick futuristic, AI names. That's fine. The orchestrator to enforce if it sees that the AI is that the agent is lacking slacking, not really doing anything, just.**** Making things worse. It needs to stop it, stop it, Kick It Out. It's not a fall back. We bring another agent in. Thank you. The agents need to be sharp on point. They need to know exactly what they're doing, exactly what their goals are. Just like how horses are. They cannot see the right, they cannot see the left. They can see straight. One thing and 1 thing, only one goal. Each run, every time each task this needs to be. So precise that there should not even be an inch or a millimeter of a problem. Or an issue? Do we have a deal and. Ho, whoa, whoa, whoa wait. The number one. Rule if you agree to this. Whatever you guys create, whatever you create, whatever you build right now, it needs to be completely production ready. I don't have time for games, for tests. You want tests. I have 125. Projects that AI built for me this past year. That destroyed it, build it, and destroyed it. That's been sitting in my repo. With zero completions. So trust me, I have 125 Massive, huge folders. We can test all you want, but it will be real tests, not fake. Do you? Agreed to this. Either we can send. The agent into the GIT repository. Or we can do this locally, whichever you like. It's since it's for myself, I'm down for local. Now you tell me exactly what I need to. Include you said redis Do you need a database? What else do you need?
