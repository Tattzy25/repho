The following is what I'm trying to do. Don't ask me any questions, just do it. I have The environmental variables set up. Let me know if you need me to set anything else up before. You start doing your thing

here is my vision and its doable 

Please thoroughly analyze the images I've sent. Identify it. Understand it. Understand the flow of it. Summarize it. Be a master at it and also. Thoroughly searched, scrape whatever you need to do. You have all the tools. You have a lot of MCP tools you can use MCP connections. You can use tools you are connected. Get all the information how? Codex works https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud   How it works? How it operates? How we can? Architect. A strategy we can build something similar to codecs, but with 4 agents working parallel. Simultaneously. And one. Orchestrator. Which would be the 5th agent. Routing and. Calling the tools, calling the agents. When it's their turn to go for. A Python script for. Modularizing Big zipped folder. Here's how it would go down. This is my vision.

so we hook up five agents first agent runs through every single file every single folder. Every single line creates the manifest of how many files in each counts it 10 seconds or possibly 20 seconds after we run a second agent automatically to double check the first agents work not to criticize but to make sure yes it was actually for example example 355 lines on one file 2000 on the other etc catches a mistake quickly fixes it. That’s all it does third agent comes in 20 seconds after the first agent not to the file folder, but to the manifest goes through the manifest creates the file folders all of it just the files and folders only with no code the fourth agent 20 seconds after comes to the manifest again and starts looking for inconsistent file folder, structure in case the third agent missed and starts fixing it or going through it the fifth agent he’s just the orchestrated stands there or sister or lays down or whatever the hell he does and just to oversee things we could even do it where it doesn’t wait 20 seconds and then goes like the second agent the third or the fourth we have the orchestra watching once it finishes for example, the first agent once it’s completed doing its thing orchestrated cause the second one and just so they don’t bump heads in case the other one is faster than the other one so they don’t overlap each other once a file folders are complete orchestrate cause the first agent again first agent start creating one set of files so I think what is it normally utilities components I think there’s like four different folders right or four different sections. I’m not sure exactly but however, many sections it is the second round of the first agent what it does is only the first set. Let’s say from each folder that they split broke apart each folder usually is gonna have those four different or five different utilities components and what not index if it has index second agent does the second one third agent does the third one fourth agent does the fourth file but the same in that same category like utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, utilities, or index index index index you know what I mean until all the files are completely filled up if it’s like six or seven files it’s fine once the first agent is completed, it just goes back into queue. Second one is completed. Goes back into queue. Wait for the orchestra to call once all the files are completed. Folders are completed. All four agents go through it one more time just to make sure whatever was created matches the original file And folder this would typically be for a bigger job it’s not about speed. It’s about quality so even if this takes altogether, let’s say 10 minutes to do or one hour to do so be it and then for the little job we can use two agents and orchestra copy paste code or upload for the little jobs same thing for the bigger ones upload an entire project project folder. Is this doable with a python code maybe?


Put a bulletproof vision. Bulletproof solution. Bulletproof. Blueprint, bulletproof rules, bulletproof instructions. Simplified. On how we are going to accomplish that vision and execute it. 

all components including sandbox will be from vercel ai sdk and shadcn ui only modern comonants nothing old , we will use ai gateway for the models - IT USES 1 API KEY OR OIDC TO WIRE UP 100+ MODELS AT A TIME So if we want to send 50 agents for example, we can do this and accomplish this with one API key. 1 API wiring I have the complete setup. If you want I can send you the documentation. The setup is just to get you started with. The actual AI gateway. Implementation. Rule number three is going to be no fall backs. Zero fall backs. I know AI, gateway loves to do fall backs. If it. Has it. That's fine. For anything else besides AI, gateway, zero, fall backs. I don't care what it is, if we have a problem, it needs to pop up a message saying you have a problem or you there's an error. #4. This is for myself. This is not for nobody else to not put any authentications. I don't want it. I don't care for it. I don't need it. It's only mine. There's no login. None of that crap. Do you understand????   If we have to and we need to. And I'm sure we do need to, because we need to track every single step of the way streaming in real time. With. 5 chat interfaces. Lined up. So we could watch and see every second what? The agent is thinking what it's doing, what every step. On top of that, we are logging every single thing, so we will have 6 boxes on the screen. We don't need a landing page, none of that stuff. All in all we need to do is have 6 chat boxes. Like a control panel type. Three on the top, three on the bottom, nicely, neatly with. The components that I told you that we're going to use from. So we can see every step of the way. Only do I have a emergency stop button. And a pause and pause and start button In case we stop them. We communicate with the orchestrator and we can communicate at all times with the orchestrator. You need to write a blueprint. Put together architecture of how it's gonna be. Visually create. I don't know what is called the not the Kanban, the other one, but. The grid canva grid boxes of. The actual workflow, how it's going to be done? I need another file for rules, another file for instructions each. Agent will have a name, not a number. The orchestrator will have a name. You can pick futuristic, AI names. That's fine. The orchestrator to enforce if it sees that the AI is that the agent is lacking slacking, not really doing anything, just.**** Making things worse. It needs to stop it, stop it, Kick It Out. It's not a fall back. We bring another agent in. Thank you. The agents need to be sharp on point. They need to know exactly what they're doing, exactly what their goals are. Just like how horses are. They cannot see the right, they cannot see the left. They can see straight. One thing and 1 thing, only one goal. Each run, every time each task this needs to be. So precise that there should not even be an inch or a millimeter of a problem. Or an issue? Do we have a deal and. Ho, whoa, whoa, whoa wait. The number one. Rule if you agree to this. Whatever you guys create, whatever you create, whatever you build right now, it needs to be completely production ready. I don't have time for games, for tests. You want tests. I have 125. Projects that AI built for me this past year. That destroyed it, build it, and destroyed it. That's been sitting in my repo. With zero completions. So trust me, I have 125 Massive, huge folders. We can test all you want, but it will be real tests, not fake. Do you? Agreed to this. Either we can send. The agent into the GIT repository. Or we can do this locally, whichever you like. It's since it's for myself, I'm down for local. Now you tell me exactly what I need to. Include you said redis Do you need a database? What else do you need?

you can use as many api as you need i have it all 

Don't just write it in the chat. Make files. II just told you make files for everything. Documented starting now. Document everything. Make files, folders. Keep it modular. We're building something to be modular. To make other folders modular, so we need to set an example and be extremely modular ourselves , i have redis upstash message q does that work ? we can use neon for postgres right ? Are we able to? Supply the orchestrator with any type of tools that they need. Even via MCP, I don't care. If yes, let's kick start a server. With MCP and. We could even communicate with the orchestrator that way. Yes, you should do number 7. Start number 7. Back end. Listen, this is what we're gonna do. This is very important because this is where AI loves to play around games. File names if it's back end file names. Or if it's back end folders and files it needs to say back end. If it's front end, it needs to say front end. Modular as possible. We can do  VENV With the six chat interfaces. Let's also somewhere. Maybe on the Left side. or something Put like a Control Panel I have a perfect dashboard. We can use every. Thing will fit perfectly fine in there. Do you want it? It's literally one click install. That's it. We have a dashboard. With everything. Customizable to our needs. Do you want to start with it? We will deploy Vercell for the back end. As a serverless function plus Redis, yes.

check out eirther or npx shadcn@latest add sidebar-11

npx shadcn@latest add sidebar-12

npx shadcn@latest add sidebar-16

Figure out which one I'm getting redis in here an neon You still didn't give me a list of exactly what I need to install.



We are not going to create additional pages on top of each other. OK. We're going to use one page with hashed sidebar tabs Or whatever it's called. The sidebar never changes. The header never changes. We're always gonna be on that same. URL, just the tabs and the content on the right side change. For the MCP server, use Typescript. From what I've been hearing, it's better than anything. If you want, I can get you the original documents. and continue



Here are some of the files for AI gateway implementation.

Please conduct a thorough, thorough, thorough investigation. Analyze everything so we get this down simplified. As easy as possible.

https://vercel.com/tattzy/~/ai/quick-start

https://vercel.com/tattzy/~/ai/model-list

https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway

And let me know what models you're choosing. And wait for my approval on the models. If we need to bring. More Apis, that's totally fine. I even have open router. I have open AI groq Whatever we need. 


PLEASE FIX IT ALL UP
